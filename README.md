## Design

### Flexbox
Using flexbox rather than margins or borders. This will keep the code more clean and responds easier to responsive design.

### Color scheme
To tie the game on the webpage togheter I used two main colors rgb(161, 161, 229) for text. #250d9e7f as a frame around button images and underline some text to match with the background-image that has multiple shades of blue in it.

### Background-image
I wanted my webpage to have a background that goes well with the color of the img buttons as well as the text color.

### Buttons with Icon
Keeping it simple and clean so user can focus mainly on the game. If user is unsure they will easily find the icons easy to accsess and understandeble any time during their game.

### Buttons with img
Tying it all togheter with the purple color for the buttons with a frame the same color as some parts of the background-image. When user hovers over the button it will slightly scale softly up and down when user moves the mouse from it.

### Game history
Created game history with a lower opacity so user can see what selection was actually played from "you" and "computer" without it taking over the whole game, easy for the eye. The winner of that round will show easily as the image will appear darker and stand out. If it's a tie or a loss the opasity will remain low.

### Typhography
For heading and texts "Poor Story regular 400" is used. It has a playfull look to it that will work with the rest of the website. I only use one font to keep it easy, since the background has different shades of blue i didnt want to make the rest messy.
