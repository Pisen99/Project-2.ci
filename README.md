# Rock, Paper & Scissor +   [Play the game here!](https://pisen99.github.io/Project-2.ci/)
RockPaperScissor+ is a simple game for all the ages. It's most common to play as kids but even grown ups play this game. The game is played when you want to settle something between two people. It's easy to compare the idea behind the game to "coin-flipping" or "rolling a dice", winner gets to decide what to do after that. First to five wins the dispute between the two people.

## Excisting Features

## f1 Header and buttons
    The header and buttons has an easy navigation to it on different devices, 380px, 768px and 3840px.
    It will be easy to find the buttons right under the logo with a simple yet informative icon.
    The icons will make a smal but noticible change when user hovers over them.
    Once you press the book icon it will appear with the rules for the game and an easy navigation to go back to the game.

## f2 Background image
    I wanted to create a background to give the website a more fun approach to it making the user want to stay for longer.

## f3 Footer
    I made this for the user to see who made the game. In the footer the name "Pisen99" is highlighted and linked to all the github repositories created by that name. The inspiration for this idea is from https://iama3191.github.io/rock-paper-scissors-lizard-spock/.

## Design

### Flexbox
* Using flexbox rather than margins or borders. This will keep the code more clean and responds easier to responsive design.

### Color scheme
* To tie the game on the webpage togheter I used two main colors, Rebecca Purple for shadowing and border frames. I used Cultured to set text color and style icons. The rest of the colors were used in shading text-boxes to create an ombre effect and reflect all the colours being used on the website.

### Background-image
* I wanted my webpage to have a background that goes well with the color of the img buttons as well as the text color.

### Buttons with Icon
* Keeping it simple and clean so user can focus mainly on the game. If user is unsure they will easily find the icons easy to accsess and understandeble any time during their game. A simple highlight of the buttons will appear when user hovers over them.

### Buttons with img
* Tying it all togheter with the purple color for the buttons with a frame the same color as some parts of the background-image. When user hovers over the button it will slightly scale softly up and down when user moves the mouse from it.

### Game history
* Created game history with a lower opacity so user can see what selection was actually played from "you" and "computer" without it taking over the whole game, easy for the eye. The winner of that round will show easily as the score will increase by one point.

### Typhography
* For heading and texts "Poor Story regular 400" is used. It has a playfull look to it that will work with the rest of the website. I only use one font to keep it easy, since the background has different shades of blue i didnt want to make the rest messy.


## Technological used

      HTML5

      Github/Gitpod used to save code, commits and pushes.


## Validator test
      
### HTML:
First time I tried it, I expected everything to work but it seemed to be a missed spelling on line 37 '<section>'. This makes sense to why I couldn't add the footer that I had planed to do. I fixed the spelling mistake and added the footer. I changed some sections that doesn't have any headings to divs.

Before and after I changed the spelling error and made section in to divs instead, here's the result:
* First test.

## JavaScript:
A smal comment on this part. "d" in my JavaScript is only used for one thing, that is "d.remove()".
